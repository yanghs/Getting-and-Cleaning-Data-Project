Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
=================================
This is a Repo for the submission of the course project for the Courseta-- Getting and Cleaning Data .

Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set, and to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository. (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#)

This repo consists with three documents. README.md introduces the purpose of the prodect. Codebook.md procides the details of the data and run_analysis.R performs the tasks of the project.

Project Summary

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
